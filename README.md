  <p align = center> Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository.  I am teaching myself how to program not just in Python but in an array(excuse the pun...did I use that correctly?) of languages.  Python is a focus right now, however.  Stick around.  Read some code.  Feel free to execute any .exe files you find(if you fear of malware please run a scanner....I am not here for such cruelties, though I promise) or just do what I primarily do on github and read the code.  Leave a comment.  Leave a recommendation.  Be respectful and you'll get the same in kind.  Appreciate you stopping by.
